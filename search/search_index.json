It can impair basic infrastructure and threaten lives and livelihood.  The urgent need for an improved predictive understanding of CF and its impact on  sediment dynamics (SD) and riverine saltwater intrusion (rSWI) at global scales under a future climate is well recognized. </p> <p>However, several shortcomings in the current version of the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE\u2019s)  Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM),  including those related to model structure, lack of mechanistic representation of key processes,  and coarse spatial resolution, pose limits.  Efforts towards improved predictions using E3SM are also restricted by the lack of portability of  the current E3SM\u2019s river model on DOE\u2019s exascale-class supercomputers, which have heterogeneous computing architectures.</p> <p></p> <p>The project objectives of this interdisciplinary research are to develop a  rigorously verified and validated river dynamical core (RDycore) for E3SM,  which includes e\ufb00icient and scalable solvers for DOE\u2019s exascale-class supercomputers,  for the study of CF and its impacts on SD and rSWI in a changing climate.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>RDycore is funded by the US Department of Energy's (DOE's) Scientific Discovery Through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) program through a joint parternship between  the DOE Office of Science's  Biological and Environmental Research and Advanced Scientific Computing.</p>"},{"location":"presentations.html","title":"Presentations","text":""},{"location":"presentations.html#2023","title":"2023","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Feng, D., Tan, Z., Bisht, G., Xu, D., Pinel, S.

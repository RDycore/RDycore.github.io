Project objectives (PO) PO1 : Develop a rigorously verified and validated RDycore for E3SM to mechanistically model pluvial, fluvial, and coastal CF and their impacts on SD and rSWI Q1.1: What is the impact of using alternative formulations of SWE and SD on computation cost and the accuracy of CF, SD, and rSWI estimates? Q1.2: What is the impact of alternate mesh structures on computation cost and accuracy of representation of CF, SD, and rSWI PO2 : Develop computationally efficient and scalable RDycore and assess its performance on heterogeneous computing architectures Q2.1: What is the computational advantage of using AMR over a spatially uniform subkilometer grid? Q2.2: What kind of scalable, multiscale preconditioner and solvers will be effective for RDycore? Q2.3: How far can strong scalability be pushed for RDycore on heterogeneous computing architectures? PO3 : Improve the predictive understanding of CF, SD, and rSWI due to the simultaneous but uncertain occurrence of multiple drivers of floods in a changing climate Q3.1: How do uncertain future changes in the joint drivers of floods affect the prediction of CF? Q3.2: How do uncertain future changes in the joint drivers of floods affect the prediction of SD? Q3.3: How do uncertain future changes in the joint drivers of floods affect the prediction of rSWI? Q3.4: How do uncertainties of model parameters affect the prediction of CF, SD, and rSWI in a changing climate?
